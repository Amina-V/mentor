# Senpai - Empathic AI Mentor Chrome Extension 

## Summary

This Chrome extension is an offshoot of my master's research on Human-Computer Interaction(HCI). My goal is to create an empathetic AI mentor plug-in that works alongside users as they complete professional upskilling courses. Learning should be enjoyable and engaging!



In progress!

- [x] Basic plugin
- [x] Video snapshots to Hume API and show emotional response.
- [x] Empathic Voice interaction
- [ ] Q&A
- [ ] Clean / Updated UI

Usability testing for this project's UI will be conducted in Figma before being implemented in the plug-in.
Thank you, Zachary Greathouse(@zgreathouse) from Hume.AI, for publishing the original extension repo!
