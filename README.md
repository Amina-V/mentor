# Senpai - Empathetic AI Mentor Chrome Extension [WIP]

## Summary

This Chrome extension is part of my master's research in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI). The goal is to create an empathetic AI mentor plug-in that works alongside users as they complete professional upskilling courses. 

 Will implement an EVI (emotional voice interface) based on Hume AI's tools and a chat assistant with GPT-4o.

In progress!

- [x] Basic plugin
- [x] Video snapshots to Hume API and show emotional response.
- [ ] Voice interaction
- [ ] Q&A

Usability testing for this project's UI will be conducted in Figma before being implemented in the plug-in.
Thank you, Zachary Greathouse(@zgreathouse) from Hume.AI, for publishing the original extension repo!
